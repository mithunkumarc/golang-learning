control and looping statements body enclosed with curly braces.

curly braces should start at the end of statment in same line.
eg : 
    for ... { //brace should start here

    }

    if brace is skipped or moved to next line. compiler throws error.
    if brace is missed golang treats end of each statement. so infers as body missing.

No Need to give break statement in switch case :
switch statement by default provide break statement for
each case.
